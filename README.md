This is an application running on tkinter (Python) and using a PostgreSql database using psycopg2 package.
I made it to keep track of my job applications in a more orderly fashion, your welcome to try it yourself.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. You need to install PostgreSql on your machine.
2. You need to setup your environment variables.
3. Your good to go :)


FEATURES:
1. Automatically connect to PostgreSql so no need to manually connect every time.
2. Automatically saves on a .csv file the current applications (on default the file will be in the project directory, but you can change it to save wherever you want)
3. Add, Update, Delete, Print jobs with a simple click.
